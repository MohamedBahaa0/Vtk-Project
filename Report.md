# Project: VTK webapp

##### by: Omar Essam, Mohamed Bahaa, Youssef El Gazzar, Mohamed Ahmed Hamed

#### Problems we faced in:
- Designing webapp
- Toggling between modes

#### Designing Webapp 
- we added a front page to the user to choose which mode to start with 

#### Toggling between modes 
1. After choosing the mode, we were unable to change the mode 
- We used AddQuerySelector function that allows changing mode once again 
2. Toggling between two modes was allowed only once


#### Output 

- front page:
